# STM32-F103C8Tx

ROBOT PROGRAM, VEHICLE WITH THE ARM TO MAKE CARRYING LOADS

FULL program in a rar file

The main objective of this work was to build and design software a prototype vehicle with the arm to make carrying loads. Design is based on a four-wheel chassis. During its implementation has been paid attention to use ultrasonic sensors, Wi-Fi module and program code for a microcontroller. Moving and movement of the robot arm was carried out using a mobile application for Windows Phone 8.1 that allows the remote control. The microcontroller STM32 is programmed on the basis of the HAL library.
